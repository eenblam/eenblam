### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben! I use he or they pronouns.

I'm currently at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) just having fun with programming, which you can read a bit about [on my blog](https://eenblam.github.io). Most recently, I worked on infrastructure at [EFF](https://www.eff.org). I've also worked with community networks, ISPs, live event networks, and more.

Things I like:
* Network programming and backend development in Go
    * Python and PostgreSQL are also cool ;)
* Web scraping, data wrangling, and building tools to support journalism and digital research
* Math - mostly recreationally, but I love when it fits into my work!
* People! I'm passionate about how different folks learn and grow together, how to maintain happy and healthy teams, and things like that. People are cool.
